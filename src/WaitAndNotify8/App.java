    * A thread that owns the objectâ€™s monitor (for instance, a thread that has entered a synchronized
    * section guarded by the object) may call wait() to temporarily release the monitor and
    * give other threads a chance to acquire the monitor. This may be done, for instance, to wait for
     * a certain condition.
    *
    *
     When another thread that acquired the monitor fulfills the condition, it may call object.notify()
     or object.notifyAll() and release the monitor. The notify method awakes a single thread in the waiting
     state, and the notifyAll method awakes all threads that wait for this monitor, and they all compete for
      re-acquiring the lock.
